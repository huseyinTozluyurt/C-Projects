# C-Projects
# 🖥️ C++ Console Applications Collection

Welcome to my **C++ Console Applications Master Repository**, featuring a curated set of beginner-to-intermediate level console-based programs written between **2022 and 2025**.

Each project here represents a step in my programming journey — from early experiments in login systems and encryption to more structured applications like hotel managers, shopping simulations, and file-based authentication systems.

## 📂 Folder Structure

| Project Folder                | Description                                                  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `loginapp_2022`              | Username/password system with file-based login & recovery    |
| `vivacars_shop`              | Console car shopping simulator with price and budget logic   |
| `hotel_management`           | Hotel + food inventory ordering app with daily sales report  |
| `password_encryption`        | Custom reversible cipher (educational only)                 |

> 📌 Each project folder includes its own `README.md`, source `.cpp` file(s), and optionally test data or compiled output (if applicable).

## 📅 Timeline & Evolution

Some of these applications — like `loginapp` — date back to **2022**, with visible markers such as `"IstanbulSakinleri 2022"` in saved files. Others reflect newer habits and better practices developed over the years. This repo intentionally preserves that timeline to show how far things have come.

## 💡 Purpose

- 🔁 Preserve legacy code to remember how it all started
- 🧪 Refactor old ideas with improved techniques
- 🛠️ Test and debug low-level C++ mechanics
- 🧱 Lay a foundation before jumping into GUI, Web, or Embedded dev
